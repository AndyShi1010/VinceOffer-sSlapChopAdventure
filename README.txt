[GAME SUMMARY]

If you don't understand some of the references, I suggest you search up the Slap Chop Ad on YouTube. Also check out penguinz0's channel while you're at it.

Vince Offer discovers that Billy Mays stole his product, the Slap Chop, and was planning to rebrand it as a new and improved Quick Chop. Angry, he sets out on a mission to defeat Billy Mays and get his stolen product back. In the end, Billy gets arrested for intellectual property theft.

[GAMEPLAY]

Use mouse controls to move the aircraft up and down to shoot enemies as they come. During boss battles, try to avoid the attacks and shoot the boss.
